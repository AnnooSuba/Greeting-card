In this project, I created a heartfelt birthday greeting using HTML and CSS. 
I styled the text and button elements, ensuring they looked appealing and conveyed my emotions effectively.
I learned to use CSS properties like color, font-family, and box-shadow to enhance the design. 
This experience was both enjoyable and rewarding, as it allowed me to express my creativity and improve my web development skills.
